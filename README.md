JAXWS Basic Application
==

This is for my IT120P class under Ms. Antonette Gabriel. The task is to do arithmetic operations using JAX framework.

## Steps
1. Download netbeans
2. Open folder with netbeans
3. Make sure that under Build Path > Libraries are properly set
4. Make sure that you have **Java 1.8** as this **may not work on newer versions** (Java SE or JDK will work fine)
5. Debug SOAPPublisher as this runs the web service
6. Debug / Run Client > OperatorClient.java

#### That's basically it.
